## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a versatile backend oriented ***Software Engineer*** based out of Seattle. I am passionate about leveraging AI to streamline and automate engineering workflows, including QA and process automation. In my personal time, I enjoy playing pickeball, going to the gym, and skiing. I also have a photography hobby where I primarily focus on street photography and portraits/headshots and enjoy taking my Sony camera wherever I go ðŸ“·

I received my Bachelors of Science in ***Computer Engineering at Purdue University*** in May 2022.
